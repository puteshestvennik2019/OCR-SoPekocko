## **Open Classrooms project.**

This is my backend for [this review website](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6).

### **Installation**
Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Add `.env` file in the root directory and fill in your *environment variables* (you can also add `PORT`):
```
CLOUDINARY_NAME=example
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=example
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=example
DB_USER=example
DB_PASS=example
JWT_SECRET=example
```

### **Usage**
Run `nodemon server` to start the application. Nodemon will restart the server on detecting changes.
